**Book:** Partner, Don't Police: AI in the Business Classroom

---

## Option 1: Collaborative Hands (Recommended)

```
Book cover design. Two figures at a desk viewed from above - a human hand and a geometric/digital hand working together on the same document, side by side rather than opposing. Warm professional lighting, clean minimal background in soft navy or slate blue. The composition suggests collaboration and shared purpose, not surveillance. Academic/professional feeling. Title "Partner, Don't Police" in clean sans-serif typography. Subtitle "AI in the Business Classroom". Professional book cover style, high quality render.
```

## Option 2: Contrast/Transition

```
Book cover design. Split composition: on left, a fading magnifying glass (surveillance, policing); on right, two hands reaching toward each other (partnership). The right side is warmer and more prominent. Clean minimal background transitioning from cool grey to warm cream. Title "Partner, Don't Police" in clean sans-serif typography. Subtitle "AI in the Business Classroom". Professional book cover style, high quality render, modern educational aesthetic.

## Option 3: Abstract Venn Diagram

```
Book cover design. Two overlapping circles forming a Venn diagram intersection - one organic/warm toned, one geometric/cool toned - meeting in a collaborative center. Clean minimal background in professional slate blue. The intersection is highlighted, suggesting productive partnership. Title "Partner, Don't Police" in clean sans-serif typography. Subtitle "AI in the Business Classroom". Professional book cover style, high quality render.
